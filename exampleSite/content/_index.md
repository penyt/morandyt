# TITLE IN THE HOME PAGE  
This is a Hugo Theme made by penyt, called "**Morandyt**".  The name comes from the color tone Morandi.

If you like this hugo theme, give us a little ⭐️ on github!  

By the way, I have made a tmux script called [tmux-pencil](https://github.com/penyt/tmux-pencil). You may take a look at it on my GitHub. It is a simple bash script that can help you easily set up your `.tmux.conf` without installing any tmux plugin.
